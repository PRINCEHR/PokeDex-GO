Hello! I'm the Professor Oak, I am creating this app so you can start your Pok√©mon adventures, and nothing better to be part of a community of Pok√©mon trainers.

I want you to help me grow the community and have incredible adventures together!
Now is your chance to talk to other nearby trainers from each team, create events to lead the greatest battles, share your experiences with other players and make friends wherever you go.

Feel free to send your comments and/or suggestions to: jdnichollsc@hotmail.com
